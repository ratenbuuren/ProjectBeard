## Unity settings
Make sure that Unity is configured correctly for version control.

In the editor, go to the menu `Edit > Project Settings > Editor`

Then, set the following settings: 

  `Version Control > Mode = Visible Meta Files` and 
  
  `Asset Serialization > Mode > Force Text`
  
Note that these settings are enabled by default with the current project settings
